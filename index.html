            <h2>The History of Baybayin</h2>
            <div class="history-container">
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>Baybayin is an ancient Philippine script that was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries, before the Spanish colonization period. The term "Baybayin" comes from the Tagalog word "baybay," which means "to spell, write, or syllabize."</p>
                
                <h3>Writing System</h3>
                <p>Baybayin is an abugida writing system, which means it uses consonant-vowel combinations. Each character represents a consonant with an inherent "a" sound. Marks called "kudlit" are added to change the inherent vowel to "e/i" or "o/u".</p>
                
                <h3>Historical Use</h3>
                <p>Baybayin was used for personal letters, poetry, and various records. Early Spanish accounts tell of widespread literacy among pre-colonial Filipinos, with many able to read and write in Baybayin. It was used for both the Tagalog language and other Philippine languages.</p>
                
                <h3>Decline</h3>
                <p>With Spanish colonization came the introduction of the Latin alphabet, which gradually replaced Baybayin in everyday use. By the late 17th century, Baybayin had largely fallen out of use in most areas, though some remote regions continued using it into the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Revival</h3>
                <p>Today, there is growing interest in reviving Baybayin as part of Philippine cultural heritage. It appears on the Philippine peso, in government logos, art, tattoos, and modern digital typography. Various organizations promote Baybayin literacy, and there are ongoing efforts to standardize and preserve this ancient script for future generations.</p>
